# ðŸ§ª Excel Reading Test â€“ Python + openpyxl

Quick test script based on *Automate the Boring Stuff with Python* (around 54% in). Just messing around with `openpyxl` to read Excel files.

---

## ðŸ’» What it does:

- Opens an Excel file (`example.xlsx`) from your Desktop
- Grabs a range of cells (`A1:C3`) and prints each oneâ€™s value + position
- Prints out full columns and rows
- Shows how to use `.value`, `.coordinate`, `.max_row`, `.max_column`, etc.

---

## ðŸ”§ Requirements:

- Python 3
- `openpyxl` (`pip install openpyxl`)
- File: `example.xlsx` on your Desktop

---

## ðŸ§  Why this?

Just to get comfy with how Excel files work in Python. Columns, rows, cell values â€” the basics.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Reminder:

Make sure the Excel file is on your Desktop, or change the path in the script.
